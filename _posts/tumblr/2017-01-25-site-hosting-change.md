Antorca’s website has been moved to Neocities (a modern revival of GeoCities). This would allow me to update the project website without having to setup Google’s Firebase tools on multiple computers and to update the website on my mobile or tablet. Neocities also allows for greater discovery thanks to its site browsing feature! The bit.do link has been re-routed to the new site. It’s visually identical to the site that was originally hosted on Google Firebase.You can access the new site from this link:https://antorca.neocities.org/
