Antorca is a performance and usability-centric operating system based on the reputable Debian GNU/Linux distribution. It enhances the Debian experience by:configuring various system services to speed up app loading times.including security plugins (AdBlock Plus, Ghostery, HTTPS Everywhere) for Firefox to provide a secure out-of-the-box browsing experience; Adobe Flash is included to give Firefox legacy compatibility.providing users access to popular third-party apps like Google Chrome, Google Earth, Opera, Vivaldi, Spotify, and various media apps (audio editors, video editors, media codecs, etc).providing a stylish, clean and intuitive desktop (the LXDE desktop environment).

### How will releases work?

Antorca will not use the standard version numbering scheme (i.e. 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, etc). Instead it will use the year and month of its release to differentiate versions (e.g. a release in June 2017 will have a version number of 2017.06-1 = YYYY.MM-P). Patch releases or minor updates will simply have an appended number to the end of a major version number (e.g. path #2 of 2017.06 will be 2017.06-2… The first release of a new version will always be “1″, whilst testing releases will technically be 2017.06-0).

As it is uncertain when a major release will be ready for release, new major releases will be referred to by their codenames. The next or upcoming release may also be referred to as Antorca Next if a codename hasn’t been announced yet.

### When will public beta testing begin?

Public beta testing may still be a while away as I hammer out some more Bash scripts to stream line the installation experience. Antorca makes use of the Refracta remastering tools (which includes an installer), however Antorca will have its own installer built upon the installer provided by Refracta.Beta builds will simply use the date-time stamp as build numbers. Both beta and final releases will be made available on the project’s SourceForge page. New releases will be announced here.While I work on the finishing touches for the first beta, I’ll try my best to post my progress on Antorca on this blog.
