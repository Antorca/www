The second beta of Antorca 5.0 is out now! GParted has been added (it was accidentally removed in a previous build) to make partitioning and disk management simpler.

### Whatâ€™s new

#### Added

- Added GParted for disk partitioning and management

#### Changed

- Package updates (includes Firefox 55.0.2)
- New default wallpaper

#### Fixed

- N/A

### Download

You can get the latest build (2.1GB ISO image) from SourceForge.Installation informationInstall at your own risk! To install the image on to a hard disk, navigate through the start menu by going into the System category and selecting System Installer.

It is recommended to use GParted for disk partitioning before using the installer. When partitioning your disk for installation, set aside at least 256MB for an extended partition containing a linux-swap partition, whilst the main partition (which holds the system files and home folder) should be formatted as ext4 and could take up however much space you need it to.
